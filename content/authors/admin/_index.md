Hi, I’m Dezerae.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne, where I work with A/Prof Danny Hatters’ lab on understanding the fundamental machinery that keeps our cells healthy. This machinery, known as the proteostasis network, breaks down as we age, and its failure is a leading cause of neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

By giving cells toxic versions of the molecules that cause these diseases, I am able to study the way a cell’s proteostasis machinery changes during disease progression. By understanding these changes, I can then test ways to help cells keep their proteostasis network healthy.

I am also a passionate advocate for the use of programming by life scientists, after having taught myself snippets of Python and Java to aid my data analysis. By encouraging and mentoring fellow STEM women to pursue this traditionally male-dominated field, I hope to show them how integrating programming skills into their scientific research can empower them to ask more profound questions. It is my hope that by asking these profound questions of my own research, I can uncover underlying mechanisms that contribute to neurodegenerative disease.

Understanding the fundamental biology is essential for developing better, targeted therapies and will hopefully lead to improved diagnostic and preventative measures. In particular, targeting core machinery breakdowns that are common to these diseases offers the potential to impact a broad international community. It is my hope that the outcomes of my research will significantly contribute to this goal.

Thanks for stopping by – if you’d like to read more about what I get up to, check out some of my rambles or technical tidbits. If you’re more of a by-the-numbers fellow, you can find all my CV details here. Either way, feel free to drop me a comment on the contact page so I know you were here. Happy sciencing!
